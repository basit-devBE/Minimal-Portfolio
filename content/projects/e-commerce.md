# E-commerce API

A full-featured backend solution for modern e-commerce applications, delivering scalable product management, secure user authentication, and comprehensive order processing through a clean, RESTful architecture.

## System Architecture

The API follows a layered architecture pattern separating concerns for maintainability and scalability:

## Technical Implementation

### API Security

The API implements robust security measures to protect user data and ensure safe transactions:

#### Authentication System
The authentication system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless authentication. When users log in, they receive an encrypted token containing their identity information and permissions. This token must be included in subsequent API requests as a Bearer token in the Authorization header. The system validates each token's authenticity and expiration before granting access to protected resources.

#### Authorization Framework
A role-based access control system restricts access to sensitive operations based on user roles. The system supports multiple permission levels including Admin, Manager, and Customer roles. Each endpoint checks the user's role to determine whether they have sufficient privileges to perform the requested action. This prevents unauthorized access to administrative functions and ensures data privacy.

#### Security Best Practices
- Tokens expire after a configurable time period to minimize risk
- All passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before storage
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- CORS protection controls which domains can access the API
- Input validation protects against injection attacks
- HTTPS encryption secures data in transit

### Database Design

The database architecture uses a relational model with optimized schemas for:

#### User Management
Stores user profiles, authentication credentials, roles, and contact information with careful separation of sensitive data.

#### Product Catalog
Implements a flexible schema that supports complex product hierarchies, variations, and rich metadata to accommodate diverse product types.

#### Order Processing
Maintains comprehensive records of orders, payments, shipping details, and status updates with transaction integrity and audit logging.

### Performance Optimization

The API employs several performance enhancement techniques:

- **Caching Strategy**: Implements Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- **Database Indexing**: Strategic indexes on commonly queried fields
- **Query Optimization**: Careful design of database queries to minimize response time
- **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination to handle large datasets efficiently
- **Load Balancing**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling across multiple servers

### Integration Capabilities

The system provides seamless integration with external services through:

- **Webhook Support**: Push notifications for critical events like order status changes
- **Payment Gateway Connectors**: Pre-built integrations with popular payment processors
- **Shipping Provider APIs**: Real-time shipping rate calculations and tracking
- **Analytics Integration**: Event tracking for business intelligence systems
- **Extensible Plugin Architecture**: Custom extensions for specific business needs
