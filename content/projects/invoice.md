const generateRecurringInvoices = async () => {
  const recurringInvoices = await Invoice.find({
    isRecurring: true,
    nextBillingDate: { $lte: new Date() }
  });

  for (const invoice of recurringInvoices) {
    const newInvoice = new Invoice({
      ...invoice.toObject(),
      issueDate: new Date(),
      dueDate: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
      paid: false,
      _id: undefined,
      createdAt: undefined,
      updatedAt: undefined
    });

    await newInvoice.save();

    // Update next billing date
    invoice.nextBillingDate = new Date(Date.now() + invoice.billingCycleDays * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    await invoice.save();
  }
};
